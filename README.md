### Introduction ###
This Tool is designed for helping Mod Makers mod PAYDAY 3, by moving all the documentation links into one tab, allowing for easy file cleanup using Prefixes and by giving an easy of way packaging your mod in a 
Mod manager friendly way. This tool has been written in Python by me (Tarek), but a lot of big Modders in the Scene have given permission for their Guides to be used in the tool.


### Features ###
- Tabs for better sorting also allows for easier expanding of Functionality (Contributing these tabs will be a lot easier. More explained in the Contributing Section)
- Mod Packaging tab for easy compatibility with Mod Managers
- Documentation Tab for all the google doc guides that are spread through out MWS

### Setup ###
Download the Zip and just extract the Folders.
Go into the "PAYDAY 3 Modding Tool" folder and click on "PAYDAY 3 Modding Tool.exe"
If you need to select the CSV files, go into the resource folder and select them there. (Youll have to manually update it as I havent found a way to automatically do that.)


### Running the Tool ###
Run "PAYDAY 3 Modding Tool.exe"



### Contributing ###
Everyone can easily contribute a feature just by adding a new tab under the tabs folder and calling it "tabname.py" (tabname will be the name of your tab), You just gotta add all your functionality and then use
the styles from the styles.py file which are provided by me. And then you just gotta go into the app.py file and add your Tab there with your actual name.
