### Introduction ###
This Tool is designed for helping Mod Makers mod PAYDAY 3, by moving all the documentation links into one tab, allowing for easy file cleanup using Prefixes and by giving an easy of way packaging your mod in a 
Mod manager friendly way. This tool has been written in Python by me (Tarek), but a lot of big Modders in the Scene have given permission for their Guides to be used in the tool.


### Features ###
- Tabs for better sorting also allows for easier expanding of Functionality (Contributing these tabs will be a lot easier. More explained in the Contributing Section)
- Mod Packaging tab for easy compatibility with Mod Managers
- Documentation Tab for all the google doc guides that are spread through out MWS

### Setup ###
Install the Requirements from requirements.txt

Run this command in your Tool Folder by going into your Explorer and typing "cmd" into the top filepath bar:
"pip install -r requirements.txt"
(without "" of course)


### Running the Tool ###
Run main.py (will be this way till I can make it an exe)



### Contributing ###
Everyone can easily contribute a feature just by adding a new tab under the tabs folder and calling it "tabname.py" (tabname will be the name of your tab), You just gotta add all your functionality and then use
the styles from the styles.py file which are provided by me. And then you just gotta go into the app.py file and add your Tab there with your actual name.
